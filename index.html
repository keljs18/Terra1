            <p>Hello! My name is Keller Sims, I was born and am still living in Portland, Maine, United States. I am currently a full time worker and student with my learning focus being programming. I enjoy being more of an independent learner and while I know dont adhere greatly with widely traditional learning methods, I am a quick and knowledgable learner when given real / practical learning experiences and opportunities to be hands on. In short, I learn efficiently when I can attempt and fail because it creates a more complete understanding for me. Personally this is why I feel programming is such a great fit, it's all a puzzle and if the product isn't right, its because a piece is missing, and once you have all the pieces it all comes together nicely</p>
